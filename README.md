# Jittor-Pytorch-Image-Models
Original copyright of Ross Wightman, modifications by VIP Group. 

Pytorch-image-models is an excellent project created by Ross Wightman and perfected by many outstanding contributors. More about pytorch-image-models: https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models    
Jittor is a high-performance deep learning framework based on JIT compiling and meta-operators. More about Jittor deep learning framework: https://github.com/Jittor/jittor  

We reproduced part of pytorch-image-models(mainly timm) in Jittor deep learning framework. By using timm-jittor, you can easly use pytorch models provided by timm and fine-tune on Jittor. We give an easy demo and one training sample which may help you get started faster.  

## Now Supported Models

- resnet: Including resnet, tv_resnet, resnext, etc.
- vit: Including vit_large models, deit, vit_base_resnet50 models, etc.
- resnetv2
